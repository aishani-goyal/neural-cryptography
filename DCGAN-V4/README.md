### Results show the architecture is fundamentally sound:

- ✅ Stage 1: 92.2% accuracy (SUCCESS!)
- ✅ Bob final: 98.3% similarity (near-perfect reconstruction)
- ⚠️ Eve: 51.8% similarity (too high - needs improvement)
- ⚠️ Security Ratio: 1.90x (needs to be >3x)

<b>The Problem:</b> Eve is learning too well. She's getting ~52% similarity, which means she's partially breaking the encryption.

## Root Cause Analysis:

Keys aren't integrated strongly enough. Eve can learn patterns without needing the keys because the key-XOR isn't sufficiently "locking" the encryption.
