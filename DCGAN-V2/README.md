# Critical Analysis of Results

## Problems Identified:

1. Bob Cannot Decrypt (1.37% similarity):

- Bob has the correct keys but can only recover ~1.4% of the original message
- This means the encryption is irreversible - information is being lost
- Character Error Rate of 1145% means Bob is producing 11x more characters than the input

Root cause: The architecture is too complex and losing information during encoding

2. Security is Coincidental (1.00x ratio):

- Eve performs identically to Bob (both ~1% similarity)
- The "security" is not because keys matter, but because nobody can decrypt
- This is like having a lock that's so broken even the key holder can't open it

3. Training Has Collapsed

- Accuracies stuck at 10-13% (random guessing for 256 characters is ~0.4%)
- Loss plateaued after epoch 20
- Models aren't learning meaningful patterns

## Why This Happened ?

<b>Architecture Mismatch:</b> The transformer architecture is excellent for language modeling but 're using it for encryption, which needs:

- Perfect reconstruction (no information loss)
- Deterministic transformations
- Reversible operations

<b>Key Integration Failure:</b> Despite attention mechanisms, keys still don't properly condition the encryption.

## Improved Architecture & Tech Stack

### Architecture Overview

Message (string)
↓
[Character Embedding] (256 dim)
↓
[Alice Encoder] - 3 Conv1D layers with residual - Key-XOR after each layer - Bottleneck to latent space (128 dim)
↓
Encrypted Latent (128 dim per token)
↓ (with keys) ↓ (without keys)
[Bob Decoder] [Eve Decoder] - Key-XOR operations - No key access - 3 DeConv1D layers - 4 Conv1D layers - Character prediction - Character prediction
