## Analysis of Your Results:

Stage 1 failed catastrophically - Bob only reached 22.4% accuracy instead of the required >90%. This cascaded into total system failure.

<b>The Problem:</b> Bob cannot reconstruct messages, so nothing else matters. Eve actually performs BETTER than Bob (56.5% vs 8.0%), which means the encryption is so broken that guessing works better than having the keys.

## <b>Root Cause: Architecture Still Too Complex</b>

Even the "simplified" version is failing because:

1. 3 layers is still too many for initial learning
2. 128 embedding dimension may be losing information
3. Batch size of 4 is too small for stable gradients
4. Key-XOR layer might be too aggressive initially
